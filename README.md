# Sova
Sova is a software-defined dynamic scheduling framework that combines the advantages of dynamic SR-IOV and VM live migration, and can greatly improve the network performance of the virtualized environment.

Sova works on top of popular Linux underlying solutions including ACPI Hotplug, Bonding Diver, etc, and also exploits often-used virtualization solutions, including para-virtual I/O, SR-IOV, live migration, etc.

Sova is developed based on Xen project (https://github.com/xen-project).
